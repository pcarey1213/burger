Eat-DA-Burger App

Available on Heroku! ("https://agile-retreat-59469.herokuapp.com/")

### Overview

This app is a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). The app follows the MVC design pattern; it also uses Node and MySQL to query and route data, and Handlebars to generate HTML.

### Burger App Details

* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* The app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
